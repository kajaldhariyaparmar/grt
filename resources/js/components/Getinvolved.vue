                <h4>Excellence</h4>
                <p class="font-italic">
                  "[Ihsan is] to worship God as though you see Him, and if you
                  cannot see Him, then indeed He sees you." (Bukhari)
                </p>
                <p>
                  At Human Appeal, we consistently strive to fulfil our duty to
                  humankind with ihsan – excellence. Since 1991, our staff have
                  been dedicated to professional and exceptional
                  humanitarianism. We aim to excel in all that we do in order to
                  provide effective and efficient support to the most
                  vulnerable, and to fulfil our duty to Allah.

                <h4>Accountability and transparency</h4>
                <p>
                  To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in
                  the earth. Whether you show what is within yourselves or
                  conceal it, Allah will bring you to account for it. (Quran,
                  2:182)
                </p>
                <p>
                  We believe in being open and honest in all that we do, sharing
                  both the challenges we face and our successes. Transparent
                  communication, regular feedback and the ability to admit when
                  we could have done better are essential features of a trusting
                  relationship and a reliable charity. Our stakeholders need to
                  be confident that they are informed about how we use our
                  resources and accomplish our goals.

                <h4>Compassion</h4>
                <p>
                  Ka’b reported: Allah Almighty said to Moses, upon him be
                  peace, “O Moses, be merciful to my creation and I will have
                  mercy on you. O Moses, I am merciful and I love those who are
                  merciful. Blessed are those who are merciful.” Hilyat
                  al-Awliya
                </p>
                <p>
                  Compassion lies at the heart of everything Human Appeal does.
                  We’re dedicated to easing the suffering of all people, and we
                  appreciate the perspectives of others when they are different
                  from our own. We provide comfort and resources freely and
                  unconditionally to those who need it, no matter who they are
                  or where they are from.

                <h4>Justice</h4>
                <p>
                  O ye who believe! Be ye staunch in justice, witnesses for
                  Allah, even though it be against yourselves or (your) parents
                  or (your) kindred, whether (the case be of) a rich man or a
                  poor man, for Allah is nearer unto both (them ye are. (Quran,
                  4:135)
                </p>
                <p>
                  We’re dedicated to working justly, distributing aid equally,
                  regardless of faith, race or gender. We strive to ensure that
                  all our work protects the most vulnerable, and our policies,
                  protection officers, audits, and spot-checks help us to ensure
                  that our work is fair, accountable, and a force for good.
